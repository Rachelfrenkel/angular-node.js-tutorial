# angular-node.js-tutorial

Used https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular to refamiliarize myself with AngularJS. Typed in everything by hand to better learn it.

This is a to-do app, where it holds a list of your inputted to-do items. Clicking on an item deletes it from mongodb.
